# 🔍📱 ScanAR

Turn any **QR code** into an **instant AR info panel** on your iPhone.  
ScanAR uses your device’s camera to detect a specific QR code and overlays helpful text, links, and status details right on screen — no extra app installs needed.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🎯 **Targeted QR** — Only reacts to the QR codes you configure.
- 🪄 **Instant Overlay** — Show titles, status, details, and links as a clean info card.
- 📱 **Web-Based** — Runs right in Safari/Chrome (no App Store build required).
- 🔧 **Customizable** — Edit one JSON object to change what’s displayed.
- ⚡ **Lightweight** — Uses [jsQR](https://github.com/cozmo/jsQR) under the hood.
